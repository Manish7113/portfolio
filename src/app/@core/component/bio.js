I use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (think building blocks) to craft websites, landing pages (fancy intro pages), and even admin panels (like the control room of a website). I also throw in React and Next.js for extra speed and efficiency. Basically, I'm the guy behind the scenes making sure websites look awesome and work flawlessly
